# 🔍 Log Analyzer: From Raw Logs to KPI Dashboards

This project is a complete walkthrough of how to analyze raw application logs, uncover actionable insights, and convert them into meaningful KPIs — all visualized on an interactive dashboard. It's ideal for developers, analysts, and product teams looking to build observability and monitoring from the ground up.

## 🚀 Features

* 📂 Raw log ingestion and parsing
* 🧹 Cleaning and feature extraction (timestamp, IP address, event type)
* 📊 KPI generation:

  * Unique IPs
  * Most accessed endpoints
  * Peak usage times
  * Anomaly detection (outlier IPs or event spikes)
* 📈 Dashboard to monitor log-based KPIs
* ⚠️ Framework to define alerting thresholds (e.g. high frequency access)

## 📊 Sample KPIs Tracked

| Metric                | Description                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `unique_ips`          | Distinct IPs interacting with system    |
| `event_spike_rate`    | % spike in events over baseline         |
| `top_resources`       | Most accessed pages/URLs                |
| `suspicious_activity` | Outlier detection using access patterns |
